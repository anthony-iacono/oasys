# Oasys
*A hotel booking manager*

## Abstract
Oasys allows hotel customers to log on view available rooms and make a booking, as well as view current and past bookings. 

## Deployment
Visit the [deployed app](https://anthony-iacono.github.io/oasys/). You may need to wait several seconds for the API server to spin up on Heroku.

## Demo

## Goals
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Architecture
  - Hotel Class: the repository for users, bookings, and rooms pulled from the [Overlook API](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api) deployed to Heroku.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - CSS/Sass
  - HTML
  - Express
  - Node.js
  - Chai & Mocha
  - Fetch API
  - Webpack

## Setup
To run the app locally:

## Planning
- App development [planned and tracked](https://github.com/anthony-iacono/oasys/projects/2) using GitHub Projects
- [Wireframe](https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/21ac20e8f474515) created using [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)

## Challenges & Wins
  - Planning out the class architecture in advance for code readability and minimal refactoring
  - Deploying the server to Heroku to allow users to demo the app without setting up a server locally
  - Implementing SCSS's many features to create modular, resusable stylesheets

## Future Iterations
  - Add a separate manager user type with the ability to delete bookings and view relevant stats, such as total revenue for today's date and current occupancy rate
